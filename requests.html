      <p>Is there an artist, album, or song that you would like to hear? I'd love to hear your suggestions. But keep in mind, that since this is a non-commercial station without a revenue stream, I can't afford to pay royalties for airplay. I'm committed to respecting artists' licensing decisions (and the law), so there are limits to what music I can play. Any music licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> is free to play. For otherwise licensed music, I can play it only if an artist gives me written permission to play their music on the station without royalty payments. Are you an artist and would like me to play your music on the station? Feel free to send me an email, I'm always looking to discover new artists.</p>
